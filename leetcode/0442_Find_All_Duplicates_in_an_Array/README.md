# 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

Given an array of integers, `1 ≤ a[i]` ≤ _n_ (_n_ = size of array), some elements appear **twice** and others appear **once**.

Find all the elements that appear **twice** in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(_n_) runtime?

**Example:**  

```text
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]
```
