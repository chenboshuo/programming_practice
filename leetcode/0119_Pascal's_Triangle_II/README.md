[leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/)

Given a non-negative index _k_ where _k_ ≤ 33, return the _k_th index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

**Follow up:**

Could you optimize your algorithm to use only _O_(_k_) extra space?
