# 274. H-Index
[leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index _h_ if _h_ of his/her _N_ papers have **at least** _h_ citations each, and the other _N − h_ papers have **no more than** _h_ citations each."

**Example:**

```text
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

**Note: **If there are several possible values for _h_, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
